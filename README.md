# Image-Encryption-and-Decryption-using-AES-algorithm
We have successfully developed a program that encrypts and decrypts the image files accurately. This will help in minimising the problem of data theft and leaks of other sensitive information. The file that we obtained after encryption is very safe and no one can steal data from this file. So, this file can be sent on a network without worrying. At the receiver side, the receiver has code for decrypting the image so that he can get the original image.
